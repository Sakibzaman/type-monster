          What are the differences between Local Storage and Session Storage?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Web Storage API consists of two mechanisms: sessionStorage and
          localStorage. Both sessionStorage and localStorage maintain a separate
          storage area for each available origin for the duration of the page
          session. The main difference between sessionStorage and localStorage
          is that sessionStorage only maintains a storage area while the browser
          is open (including when the page reloads or restores) while
          localStorage continues to store data after the browser is closed. In
          other words, whereas data stored in sessionStorage is cleared when the
          page is closed, data stored in localStorage does not expire.
