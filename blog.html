          What are the differences between Local Storage and Session Storage?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Web Storage API consists of two mechanisms: sessionStorage and
          localStorage. Both sessionStorage and localStorage maintain a separate
          storage area for each available origin for the duration of the page
          session. The main difference between sessionStorage and localStorage
          is that sessionStorage only maintains a storage area while the browser
          is open (including when the page reloads or restores) while
          localStorage continues to store data after the browser is closed. In
          other words, whereas data stored in sessionStorage is cleared when the
          page is closed, data stored in localStorage does not expire.

          What are the differences between Global Scope and Block Scope in
          Javascript?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
          known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
          that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
          function or conditional state can access that variable.Block scope is
          also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the
          scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly
          brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something
          else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the
          curly brackets {}.

        <h1>How does Event loop of javascript work?</h1>
        <p>
          An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and
          places it onto the function execution stack whenever the function
          stack becomes empty. The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript
          gives us an illusion of being multithreaded even though it is
          single-threaded. it takes the first event from the Event Queue and
          places it onto the stack i.e in this case the callback function. This
          cycle is called the event loop and this how JavaScript manages its
          events.

          Write down different ways of getting 'undefined' error in javascript.
        </h1>
        <p>
          There are 8 ways to get 'undefined' error in javascript. 1) Variable
          that is not initialized will give undefined. 2) Function with no
          return will give undefined. 3) Parameter that is not passed will be
          undefined. 4) If return has nothing on right side will give undefined.
          5) Property that does not exist on an object will give undefined 6)
          Accessing array elements outside of the index range will give
          undefined 7) Deleting an element inside an array. 8) Set a value
          directly to undefined.
